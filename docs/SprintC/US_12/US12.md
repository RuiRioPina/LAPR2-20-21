# US 012 - Record the Results of a given test

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

"As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test."

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> "At the company's headquarters, the clinical chemistry technologist receives the samples (delivered by a courier) and performs the chemical analysis, recording the results in the software application. (...)"
> "To facilitate and simplify the validation work performed by the specialist doctor, the application uses an external module that is responsible for doing an automatic validation using test reference values." 

> My interpretation:

> Basically, after performing the chemical analysis to the samples received, there is the need for the clinical chemistry technologist to record the results of it in the application. Furthermore, the application must automatically validate the results "pushed" to the application by the technologist taking into account the test reference values for each parameter. The automatic validation is done using an external module. Lastly, the automatic validation is done with the intention of facilitating the tasks performed by the Specialist Doctor (which is validating the tests).

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question1:** When the Clinical Chemistry Technologist wants to record the results of a test, how does he has access to that test? By internal code, NHS code?.
> [Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8301)
> > **Answer:** Each sample has a unique barcode. The clinical chemistry technologist should use the sample barcode number to find the test for which the sample was collected.

> **Question2:** Should the system present a result for each test parameter or a single result for the test to be recorded?
> [Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8301)
> > **Answer:** The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the test.

> **Question3:** Does this "at most" express that there are some parameters of the API request that are optional? If so, could you clarify the parameters that are optional?
> [Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8301)
> > **Answer:** "At most" means the maximum number of parameters that will be used. Depending on the API being used, all parameters above may be required or some may be optional. Did you already studied ESOFT (Protected Variations) and the APIs provided in moodle? Important: The number of parameters depends on the API that is being used.

> **Question4:** When the Clinical Chemistry Technologist wants to record the results of a test, how does he has access to that test? By internal code, NHS code?
> [Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8272)
> > **Answer:** Each sample has a unique barcode. The clinical chemistry technologist should use the sample barcode number to find the test for which the sample was collected.

> **Question5:** Should the system present a result for each test parameter or a single result for the test to be recorded?
> [Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8272)
> > **Answer:** The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the test.

> **Question6:** Wouldn't you prefer to choose a test to make the results from a list, instead of doing it by entering a barcode for that test? The interaction would be more direct clear and intuitive, but what is your decision?
> [Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8475)
> > **Answer:** Please check my previous answer: https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8301#p10894

> **Question7:** What information is the system going to have to ask the clinical chemistry technologist to be able to create the test results?
> [Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8272)
> > **Answer:** A1:The clinical chemistry technologist should use the sample barcode number to find (in the system) the test for which the sample was collected. A2: The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the (selected) test. All parameter values of the test should be filled/defined (by the Clinical Chemistry Technologist) when the use case finishes.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

The application should use an external module that is responsible for providing the test reference values. The application can use an external module for each type of test. For instance, when the results are for blood tests parameters, the externalmodule BloodReferenceValues1API can be used. When the results are for Covid-19 tests parameters, the external module CovidReferenceValues1API can be used. In any case, the API request should include, at most: (i) a key to access the module (e.g.:  “KEY1234”); (ii) a parameter identifier; (iii) the reference date; and (iv) reference measurement unit (e.g. "mg").

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a dependency on the US-10: "As an administrator, I want to specify a new parameter and categorize it.", since the automatic validation can't be done without the definition of a parameter. Moreover, the fact that it is needed to check for which test the resuls will be introduced, the Clinical Chemistry Technologist needs to scan a barcode that is contained in a sample, therefore there is a dependency with US-5: "As a medical lab technician, I want to record the samples collected in the scope of a given test", since the samples needs to have a barcode which is defined in this US.  Furthermore, there is a dependency with the US-4 "As a receptionist of the laboratory, I intend to register a test to be performed to a registered client", since it is only possible to record the results of a test if the test as been registered to a client, containing the parameters that were tested. Adittionally there is a dependency on the external module, since without it is impossible to validate the tests.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* Test Result value
	* Barcode

	
* Selected data:
	*Test parameter identifier*



**Output Data:**

*  List containing Parameters to be selected
* (In)Success of the operation

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

In this User Story it is necessary to use an external module to automatically validate the tests given the parameters of which one of them. Aditionally it is natural to say that this US will be held quite frequently, since recording the test results is one of the core activities of this company.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | RecordTestResultUI   |  **Pure Fabrication**: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | RecordTestResultController | **Controller**                             |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new TestResult? | TestResultStore | **Creator (R1)** and **HC+LC**: By the application of the Creator (R1) it would be the "Company". But, by applying HC + LC to the "Company", this delegates that responsibility to the "TestResultStore"   |
| 			  		 | ... knowing the user using the system?  | AuthFacade  | **IE:** cf. A&A component documentation.  |
| 			  		 |	... knowing to which company the user belongs to? | App  | **IE:** has registed all Companies  |
| Step 2  		 | 	|	 |	  |
| Step 3 		 |	...saving the inputted data? | Test  | **IE:** the object Test has knows its own barcode.  |
| 			  		 | ... knowing if the test with the barcode inputted exists?  | TestStore | **IE:** knows all the tests in the system and therefore all the barcodes.  |
| Step 4  		 |	...knowing the Test Parameter Selected list to show? | TestStore  | **IE:** A test has associated to itself the test parameters that were selected beforehand, therefore it is him who is the IE |
| Step 5  		 |	... saving the selected parameter? | Test  | **IE:** The test knows all its selected parameters  | 
| Step 6  		 |  |  | | 
| Step 7  		 |	...saving the inputted data?  | TestResult | **IE:** owns its data.|  
| 		 |	...knowing the test type of the Test?  | Test | **IE:** owns its data.|    
|  		 |	...knowing what API to use according the testType?  | ExternalModule | **Protected Variation:** There is a point of variation at this point, therefore it is necessary to implement a stable interface to reduce possible undesirable impact on other system' elements .|               
| Step 8  		 |	... validating all data (local validation)? | TestResult | **IE:** owns its data.| 
| 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | TestResultStore | **IE:** knows all its Test Results.| 
| 			  		 |	... saving the created Test Result? | TestResultStore | **IE:** owns all its TestResult.| 
| 			  		 |	... associating the TestResult to the Test? | TestResultStore | **IE:** owns all its TestResult.| 
| 			  		 |	... adding the Chemical Analysis Date ? | TestStore | **IE:** owns all its tests and therefore all its business transition dates.| 
| Step 9  		 |	| 	| 	|
| Step 10  		 |	... informing operation success?| RecordTestResultUI  | **IE:** is responsible for user interactions.  |               

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Test
 * TestResult


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 


 * RecordTestResultUI  
 * RecordTestResultController
 * TestResultStore
 * TestStore
 * TestParameterStore
 * App
 
 Other software classes of external systems/components:

* AuthFacade
* ExternalModule

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![US12-CD](US12-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Class TestResult**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Test class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		TestResult instance = new TestResult(null, null, null);
	}



# 5. Construction (Implementation)

**Class TestResult**

public class TestResult {
    ReferenceValue referenceValue;
    double result;
    Parameter parameter;

    public TestResult(Parameter parameter, double result, ReferenceValue referenceValue) {
        this.parameter = parameter;
        this.result = result;
        this.referenceValue = referenceValue;
    }


}

**Class ResultOfTestStore**

public class ResultOfTestStore {
    private final List<ResultOfTest> resultOfTestsStore;

    /**
     * empty constructor of the class ClientList which initializes the arraylist.
     */
    public ResultOfTestStore() {
        this.resultOfTestsStore = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public ResultOfTest createResultOfTest(double result, ReferenceValue referenceValue) {
        return new ResultOfTest(result, referenceValue);
    }

    private void add(ResultOfTest resultOfTest) {
        if (!resultOfTestsStore.contains(resultOfTest)) {
            this.resultOfTestsStore.add(resultOfTest);
        } else {
            System.out.println("At least one attribute needs to be unique. Please try again");
        }
    }


    private void saveResultOfTest(ResultOfTest resultOfTest) {
        this.add(resultOfTest);
    }


    public List<ResultOfTest> getResultOfTestsStore() {
        return new ArrayList<>(this.resultOfTestsStore);
    }

   
    public boolean isTestResultInStore(ResultOfTest c) {
        return this.resultOfTestsStore.contains(c);
    }

    public List<ResultOfTest> getResultOfTest() {
        List<ResultOfTest> resultOfTests = new ArrayList<>();
        resultOfTests.addAll(this.resultOfTestsStore);
        return resultOfTests;
    }
}

**(Building)**


# 6. Integration and Demo 

This US contains a lot of integrations with other US whether it is from Sprint B or C. With that being said, there was efforts to integrate this US12 - "As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test." with the US-4 and US-5 which have critical information for the implementation of the US-12. Aditionally, there is the need to automatically validate the test results added in this US by using an external module to handle this. This external module contains 3 automatic validation API at the moment, but there is room for more API when needed.

# 7. Observations

This US will have to be integrated in the GUI aftwards and at the moment it wasn't used DTO since the number of attributes behind handled with is quite small. The integration of DTOs is a route for further improving this US which will be taken into account in the next Sprint.
