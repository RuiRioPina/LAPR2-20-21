# US 012 - Record the Results of a given test

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

"As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test."

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> "At the company's headquarters, the clinical chemistry technologist receives the samples (delivered by a courier) and performs the chemical analysis, recording the results in the software application."
> "(...)"
> "To facilitate and simplify the validation work performed by the specialist doctor, the application uses an external module that is responsible for doing an automatic validation using test reference values." 

> My interpretation:

Basically, after performing the chemical analysis to the samples received, there is the need for the clinical chemistry technologist to record the results of it in the application. Furthermore, the application must automatically validate the results "pushed" to the application by the technologist taking into account the test reference values for each parameter. The automatic validation is done using an external module. Lastly, the automatic validation is done with the intention of facilitating the tasks performed by the Specialist Doctor (which is validating the tests).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

The application should use an external module that is responsible for providing the test reference values. The application can use an external module for each type of test. For instance, when the results are for blood tests parameters, the externalmodule BloodReferenceValues1API can be used. When the results are for Covid-19 tests parameters, the external module CovidReferenceValues1API can be used. In any case, the API request should include, at most: (i) a key to access the module (e.g.:  “KEY1234”); (ii) a parameter identifier; (iii) the reference date; and (iv) reference measurement unit (e.g. "mg").



### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Identify here any found out dependency to other US and/or requirements.*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

*Identity here the data to be inputted by the system actor as well as the output data that the system have/needs to present in order to properly support the actor actions. Regarding the inputted data, it is suggested to distinguish between typed data and selected data (e.g. from a list)*


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements ; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.* 


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXX-SD](USXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
