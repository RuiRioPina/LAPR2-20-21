# US 1 - View the results of the tests I have performed.## 1. Requirements Engineering### 1.1. User Story DescriptionAs a client, I want to access the application to view the results of the tests I have performed.### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications ### From the Specifications Document:* "Once the laboratory coordinator confirms that everything was done correctly, the client receives a notification alerting that the results are  ready available in the central application and informing that he/she must access the application to view those results."   ### From the client clarifications:> * My group is assuming that the client only wants to see the validated tests. Do you want to see tests in other states and if that's the case say the state of the test and show only the information available for that state?   > 	* Answer: The client should only see tests that have already been validated. >> * Question: Which date should be used to arrange the tests in order?The date the test is done or the validation date?     > 	* Answer: The test registration date. >> * Question: What are the data to show the customer? and in what way do we have to show? Do you have any examples you can give us?   > 	* Answer: I want to access the application to view the results of the tests I have performed. This includes the report made by the specialist doctor. The client tests must be shown ordered from the most recent to the oldest one. The test results are shown only after the client has selected a test.### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria* AC1: The client tests must be shown ordered from the most recent to the oldest one. The test results are shown only after the client has selected a test.* AC2: Only shows the validated tests.### 1.4. Found out DependenciesNo dependencies were found.### 1.5 Input and Output Data* ### Input Data	* None.* ### Output Data	* List of the clientes tests.	* Details of a test (results, report, etc.).### 1.6.

Sequence Diagram (SD)![UC1_SD](UC1_SD.svg)## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)![UC1_CD](UC1_CD.svg)# 4. Tests The added code is mostly UI, so there are no tests.# 5. Construction (Implementation)No relevant remarks.# 6. Integration and Demo This use case is not related to any US. # 7. ObservationsI believe that the code is well developed and according to the request. This UC is so simple and straightforward that cant be much to improvement.
