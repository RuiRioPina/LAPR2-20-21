# US 14 - Make the diagnosis and write a report for a given test

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a specialist  doctor, I intend to make the diagnosis  and write a report for a given test.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document**

"After completing the chemical analysis, the results of all chemical analyses are analysed by a
specialist doctor who makes a diagnosis and writes a report that afterwards will be delivered to the
client"

**From the client clarifications**

* **Question1:** Is there a limit of characters for the report and the diagnosis that will be made by the Specialist Doctor?
[Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8182)
	* **Answer1:** Yes, at most 400 words.

* **Question2:** Regarding the tests that the Specialist Doctor can write a report about. Should the SD chose from a list of tests? and Should him only receive a list of test that have completed all the previous steps?
[Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8250)
	* **Answer2:** The system shows all tests ready (that have completed all the previous steps) to make the diagnosys and the Specialist Doctor selects one test. 
Then, the Specialist Doctor writes the report for the selected test. 

* **Question3:** Can the Specialist Doctor edit a report once it has already been written? If yes, in what occasion should he be able to edit? Can he edit after the Laboratory Coordinator has already approved the report?
[Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8268)
	* **Answer3:** No. No.

* **Question4:** Once the specialist doctor decides to write the report for a given test, should the results of the chemical analysis and the reference values be presented on the screen? If not, how should the specialist doctor access the data related to the diagnosis he needs to make?
[Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8497)
	* **Answer4:** After selecting a test (to make the diagnosis/report) the results of the chemical analysis and the reference values should be presented on the screen. Then the Specialist Doctor should write the report.


* **Question5:** While in the "Make a diagnosis and write a report" option of the main menu, should the specialist doctor be able to make a diagnosis and write a report for more than one test? Or does he need to exit and enter the "Make a diagnosis and write a report" option every time he wants to make a new diagnosis and write a new report?
[Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8497)
	* **Answer5:** After writing a report the SD can choose to write other reports without leaving the use case.

* **Question6:** Although it was not asked for, should we order the list of tests to be displayed by date of chemical analysis older to newer?
[Link](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8571)
	* **Answer6:** Sorting is not required in this sprint.




### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

AC1: The report must be at most 400 words.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US has dependency with the US04 - (As a receptionist  of the  laboratory,  I intend  to  register  a test  to  be performed  to a registered  client.), US05 - (As a medical lab technician,  I want to record the samples collected  in the scope of a given test.) and US12 - (As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test.), because the specialist doctor needs to access the tests that have completed all the previous steps to make a diagnosis.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data**

* Selected data(Test to be analysed)

* Typed data (report)
	

**Output data:**

* (In)Success of the operation.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale


| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1		 |...interacting with the actor |WriteReportUI|Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsability to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
|			 |...coordenating the US        |WriteReportController |Controller |
| 			  		 | ... knowing the user using the system?  | UserSession  | IE: knows who is logged in.  |
| Step 2  		 |...knowing the tests to be analysed? |TestStore|IE: TestStore has the list of tests ready to be analysed. |
| Step 3  		 |	...saving the test chosen? | Report| IE: object created in step 1 has its own data.  |
| Step 4  		 |	...knowing the test result to show? | TestResult| IE: TestResult has the test results to shown. |
| 			 |	... requesting the needed data? |WriteReportUI| IE: run method. | 
| Step 5  		 |	... saving the typed data? | Report| IE: object created in step 1 is classified in one or more test types.  |
| Step 6  		 |	... asking for a confirmation	|WriteReportUI|IE: is responsible for user interactions.                              |              
| Step 7  		 |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Report| IE: owns its data.| 
| 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | ReportStore | IE: knows all its tasks.| 
| 			  		 |	... saving the created task? | ReportStore| IE: owns all its tasks.| 
| Step 8  		 |	... informing operation success?| WriteReportUI| IE: is responsible for user interactions.  |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Report
 * ReportStore
 * Test
 * TestStore
 * Company

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * WriteReportUI  
 * WriteReportController

# 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Check that it's possible to get the report introduced by the Specialist doctor.

    @Test
    public void getReport() {
        Report rep=new Report("Report test");
        String report = "Report test";
        String wrongReport = "Not Report test";

        assertEquals(report,rep.getReport());
        assertNotEquals(wrongReport,rep.getReport());

    }

**Test 2:** Check that it's possible to save a report.

    @Test (expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void saveReport() {
        List<ParameterCategory> pc = new ArrayList<>();
        ParameterCategory p1 = new ParameterCategory("CAT00", "Category00");
        ParameterCategory P2 = new ParameterCategory("CAT01", "Category01");
        ParameterCategory P3 = new ParameterCategory("CAT02", "Category02");
        pc.add(p1);
        pc.add(P2);

        List<ParameterCategory> p = new ArrayList<>();
        p.add(P3);
        Date data = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis());

        ...

        ReportStore rs = new ReportStore();

        Report r1 = rs.writeReport(report);
        Report r2 = rs.writeReport("");

        rs.saveReport(t1,r1);
        rs.saveReport(t2,r2);

    }

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

## Class Report

    public class Report {
    /**
     * Object oriented class to describe a report in a company text
     */
    private final String reportText;

    /**
     * Constructor for the Report
     * @param reportText
     */

    public Report(String reportText){

        this.reportText = reportText;

    }
     ...
    }

## Class ReportStore

    public class ReportStore {

    /**
     * Object oriented class used to Store the Reports within the company.
     */

    private List<Report> reports;
    private List<Test> tests;
    private Test test;

    /**
     * Constructor for the Report store.
     */

    public ReportStore(){
        this.reports=new ArrayList<>();

    }

    /**
     *
     * @param report - report of the test
     * @return Object of the Report class
     */

    public Report writeReport(String report){
        return new Report(report);
    }

    /**
     * Saves a report
     * @param t - Test
     * @param r - Report
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     */

    public void saveReport(Test t,Report r) throws IllegalArgumentException{
        validateReport(r);
        addReport(t,r);
    }
     ...
    }

## Class WriteReportController

    public class WriteReportController {

    TestStore tests = App.getInstance().getCompany().getAllTestCompleted();

    /**
     *  Controller class for the write Report funcion [US-14 of the integrative project of 1st year ISEP DEI students].
     */

    private Company company;
    private Report report;
    private Parameter parameter;

    /**
     * Constructor for the Controller class. Gets the company that is using the software.
     */

    public WriteReportController(){
        this.company=App.getInstance().getCompany();
    }

    /**
     * Gets the test that have a specific code
     * @param testCode - Code of a test
     * @return the test with a specific code
     */

    public Test getTestByInternalCode(String testCode) {
        return tests.getTestByInternalCode(testCode);
    }

    /**
     * Gets tests that don't have the diagnosis made
     * @return the tests that don't have the diagnosis made
     */

    public List<Test> getTestsWithoutDiagnosis(){
        return tests.getTestsWithoutDiagnosis();
    }
     ...
    }

## Class WriteReportUI

    public class WriteReportUI implements Runnable {

    private WriteReportController writeReportController;

    public WriteReportUI(){
        this.writeReportController=new WriteReportController();
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        Scanner x = new Scanner(System.in);
        List<TestResult>testResults=new ArrayList<>();
        int option = 0;


        do {
            option = 0;
            List<Test> lt = this.writeReportController.getTestsWithoutDiagnosis();
            String report="";
            String testCode="";
            System.out.println("Beginning to write a report.\n");

            option = Utils.showAndSelectIndex(lt, "Select test.");

            if ((option >= 0) && (option < lt.size())) {
                Report rep=null;
                testResults = lt.get(option).getTestResult();
                testCode=lt.get(option).getInternalCode();
                boolean validation = false;
                System.out.println(testResults);
                while(!validation) {
                    System.out.println();
                    System.out.println("Write Report");
                    report = x.nextLine();
                    validation = checkReportRules(report);
                    if(!validation) {
                        System.out.println("Report must have a maximum of 400 words");
                    }
                }
                validation=false;
      ...
    }


# 6. Integration and Demo 

This US needs many others to function properly, namely US4, US5, US12 and these in turn need more US developed in Sprint B, so to develop this US it is necessary that all others work well. 


# 7. Observations

It is possible that we may need to change something in this US when JavaFx is introduced.
