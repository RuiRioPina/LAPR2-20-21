# OO Analysis #

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used. 

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes ##
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development".

###**Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes**###

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

+ **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
+ **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
+ **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
+ **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
+ **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
+ **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
+ etc.



| Concept (A) 		|  Association   	|  Concept (B) |
|----------	   		|:-------------:		|------:       |
| Administrator  	| is part of    		 	| Company  |
| Company  	| owns    		 	| ClinicalAnalysisLaboratories  |
|   	| owns    		 	| ChemicalLaboratory  |
| ClinicalAnalysisLaboratories  	| collects    		 	| Sample  |
