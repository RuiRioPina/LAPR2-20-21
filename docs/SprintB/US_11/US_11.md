# US 011 - Specify a new parameter category

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an administrator, I want to specify a new parameter category.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document**

“Blood tests are frequently characterized by measuring several parameters which for presentation/reporting purposes are organized
by categories. For example, parameters such as the number of Red Blood Cells (RBC), White Blood Cells (RBC) and Platelets (PLT) are
usually presented under the blood count (Hemogram) category.”

“Regardless, such tests rely on measuring one or more parameters that can be grouped/organized by categories.”

**From the client clarifications**

**Q1:** Regarding the creation of a new category, what should be the format of the code in terms of length, should it be alphanumeric or numbers only? Also, can we assume that both attributes are mandatory?

**A1:** The format of the attributes of one category are:
    
   Name: is a string with no more than 10 characters;
    
   Code: are five alphanumeric characters. The code is unique and is not automatically generated.
    
   Both attributes are mandatory.
    
   There are no subcategories.
    
**Q2:** What are the information related to a Parameter Category?

**A2:** Each category has a name and a unique code. There are no subcategories.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Name is a string with no more than 10 characters.

**AC2:** Code are five alphanumeric characters. The code is unique and is not automatically generated.

**AC3:** Name and code are mandatory.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US has dependency with US10 (Specify a new parameter and categorize it), because a parameter is always related to a (parameter) category.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data**

Typed Data (name, code).

**Output Data**

(In)Success of the operation.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor?						 | ParameterCategoryUI            | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.          | 
|   		 |	... coordinating the US?					 | ParameterCategoryController            | Controller          |
|   		 |	... knowing the user using the system?					 | UserSession            | IE: User Authentication & Authorization Documentation       |
| Step 2  		 |	... requesting the needed data?						 |           |                              |
| Step 3  		 |	... saving the inputed data?						 | ParameterCategory           | IE:Object created in step 1 has its own data.                          |
| Step 4  		 |	... validating all data (local validation)(i.e the compliance with the acceptance criteria, the existance of the mandatory data)?						 | ParameterCategory            | IE: knows about its data       |
|   		 |	... validating all data (global validation)?)(i.e Duplicated information)						 | ParameterCategory           | 	IE: knows all its Parameter Categories.        |
| Step 5  		 |	... saving the created Parameter Category?						 | ParameterCategoryStore            | IE: owns all its Parameter Category                          |
| Step 6  		 |	... informing operation success?						 | ParameterCategoryUI            | Has the responsability to interact with the actor                             |                    

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * ParameterCategory
 * ParameterCategoryStore
 * Company

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * ParameterCategoryUI  
 * ParameterCategoryController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

![US11-CD](US11-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
