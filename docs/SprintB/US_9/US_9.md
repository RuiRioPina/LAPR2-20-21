# US 9  - Create a Type of Test## 1. Requirements Engineering### 1.1. User Story DescriptionAs an administrator, I want to specify a new type of test and its collecting methods.### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications ### From the Specifications Document:* "Many Labs performs two types of tests. (â€¦) (whether it is blood test or Covid test)."   * "Despite being out of scope, the system should be developed having in mind the need to easily support other kinds of tests (e.g., urine)."### From the client clarifications:> * Question: What are the data that characterize a test type?  > 	* Answer: Simply consider a code, a description, the collecting method and a list of parameter categories.  >> * Question: What are the business rules applicable to such data?  > 	* Answer: Code should be a alphanumeric code, description a text, the collecting method a text and the parameter category. ### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria* AC1: Code must be an alphanumeric code with 5 chars.* AC2: Description cannot be empty and has, at maximum, 15 chars.* AC3: Collecting method cannot be empty and has, at maximum, 20 chars.### 1.4. Found out DependenciesNo dependencies were found.### 1.5 Input and Output Data* ### Input Data	* Typed data: code, description and collecting method.	* Selected data: parameter category.* ### Output Data	* (In)Success of the operation### 1.6.

Rationale**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  ||:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- || Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | TestTypeUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           || 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | TestTypeController | Controller                             || 			  		 |	... instantiating a new TestType? | TestTypeStore | Creator: in the DM Company has a TestTypeStore and the store as the TestType.   || 			  		 | ... knowing the user using the system?  | UserSession  | IE: cf. A&A component documentation.  || 			  		 |	... knowing to which company the user belongs to? | App  | IE: has registed all Companies  || 			  		 |							 | Company   | IE: knows/has its own Employees|| 			  		 |							 | Employee  | IE: knows its own data (e.g. name) || Step 2  		 |	...saving the inputted data? | TesType  | IE: object created in step 1 has its own data.  || Step 3  		 |	...knowing the TestTypes categories to show? | ParameterCategoryStore  | IE: TestTypes Categories are defined by the ParameterCategoryStore. || Step 4  		 |	... saving the selected category? | TestType  | IE: object created in step 1 is classified in one or more Categories.  |          | Step 6  		 |	... validating all data (local validation)? | TestType | IE: owns its data.| | 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | TestTypeStore | IE: knows all its TestTypes.| | 			  		 |	... saving the created TestType? | TestTypeStore | IE: owns all its TestTypes.| | Step 7  		 |	... informing operation success?| TestTypeUI  | IE: is responsible for user interactions.  |              ### Systematization ##According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:  * Company * TestTypeStore * ParameterCategoryStore * TestType * ParameterCategoryOther software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: * TestTypeUI   * TesTypeController## 3.2.

Tests *In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* **_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_****Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);	}*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* # 5. Construction (Implementation)No relevant remarks.# 6. Integration and Demo *In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*# 7. Observations*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
