# US 006 - To create a Task 

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As an administrator, I want to register a new employee.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	All those who wish to use theapplication must be authenticated with a password holding seven alphanumeric characters,including three capital letters and two digits.



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**  When creating a new employee, the attributes "Employee ID" and "Doctor Index Number", are implemented by the administrator or incremented by the system?
>  
> **Answer:** Only the employee ID should be generated from the initials of the employee name and should include a number. The number has 5 digits and is increases automatically when a new employee is registered in the system. For instance, if the company has 20 employees and wants to register a specialist doctor having the name Ana Maria Santos Moura, then the the employee ID for this specialist doctor should be AMSM00021.

The Doctor Index Number should be introduced by the administrator.

-

> **Question:** Should we vallidate if a new employee is the same as one that there is already inside the system ? Do we need to vallidate same atributes to check similarities ?
>  
> **Answer:** Yes.

-

> **Question:** How should we generate the SOC number , employee ID and the doctor index number ? What type and length they should have ?
>  
> **Answer:** The employee ID should be generated from the initials of the employee name and should include a number. The number should have 5 digits and it increases automatically when a new employee is registered in the system. For instance, if the company has 20 employees and the administrator wants to register a specialist doctor with the name Ana Maria Santos Moura, then the the employee ID for this specialist doctor should be AMSM00021.

-

> **Question:** What kind of information does the company store about their employees and owned laboratories?
>  
> **Answer:** All the roles that exist in the Many Labs company are characterized by the following attributes:
Employee ID;
Organization Role;
Name;
Address;
Phone Number;
E-Mail;
Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.

The Specialist Doctor has an additional attribute:
Doctor Index Number.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** Each user must have a single role defined in the system.
* **AC2:** The "auth" component available on the repository must be reused (without modifications)
* **AC3:** When creating a task with an already existing reference, the system must reject such operation and the user must have the change to modify the typed reference.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to the auth component, since each employee will have a corresponding user.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* a name
	* a postal adress
	* a phone number
	* an email
	* a SOC (Standard Occupational Code
	* a doctor index number( if the Specialist Doctor Role is selected).
	
* Selected data:
	* Organization Role attributed to the new Employee


**Output Data:**

* List of existing Roles.
* (In)Success of the operation

**Other alternatives might exist.**

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

* The created task stays in a "not published" state in order to distinguish from "published" tasks.


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 

![US007_MD_V2](US007_MD_V2.svg)

### 2.2. Other Remarks

The design of this US is heavily inspired by the example provided on TP08 of ESOFT ,present in the ISEP moodle for 1st year LEI Students.
An attempt at using DTO (Data Transfer Objects) will be made.


## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**SSD - Alternative 1 is adopted.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the administrator? | RegisterEmployeeUI|  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | RegisterEmployeeController| Controller
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new Employee? | Company   | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Company has an Employee.   |
| 			  		 | ... knowing the user using the system?  | UserSession  | IE: Auth component documentation.  |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |	...saving the inputted data? | Employee  | IE: object created in step 1 has its own data.  |
| Step 4  		 |	...knowing the roles to show? | Company  | IE: Company contains a list of all the available roles. |
| Step 5  		 |	... saving the selected Role? | Employee  | IE: object created in step 1 contains a role.  |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              
| Step 7  		 |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Employee | IE: owns its data.| 
| 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | Company(EmployeeList | IE: knows all its Employees.| 
| 			  		 |	... saving the created task? | Company | IE: owns all its Employees.| 
| Step 8  		 |	... informing operation success?| RegisterEmployeeUI  | IE: is responsible for user interactions.  | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Employee
 * Company
 * Role

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * RegisterEmployeeUI
 * RegisterEmployeeController
 * RoleDto
 * lRoleDto

# 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Task instance = new Task(null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
	}
	

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with a reference containing less than five chars - AC2. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureReferenceMeetsAC2() {
		Category cat = new Category(10, "Category 10");
		
		Task instance = new Task("Ab1", "Task Description", "Informal Data", "Technical Data", 3, 3780, cat);
	}


*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)


## Class CreateTaskController 

		public boolean createTask(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Integer catId)() {
		
			Category cat = this.platform.getCategoryById(catId);
			
			Organization org;
			// ... (omitted)
			
			this.task = org.createTask(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			
			return (this.task != null);
		}


## Class Organization


		public Task createTask(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Category cat)() {
		
	
			Task task = new Task(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			if (this.validateTask(task))
				return task;
			return null;
		}



# 6. Integration and Demo 

* A new option on the Employee menu options was added.

* Some demo purposes some tasks are bootstrapped while system starts.


# 7. Observations

Platform and Organization classes are getting too many responsibilities due to IE pattern and, therefore, they are becoming huge and harder to maintain. 

Is there any way to avoid this to happen?
